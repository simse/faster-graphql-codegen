# ðŸš€ faster-graphql-codegen ðŸš€
A reimplementation of graphql-codegen designed to be (much) faster than the original. It aims to be drop-in compatible where possible.

## Current functionality
- [x] Parse single graphql schema from file
- [ ] Parse and merge multiple graphql schemas
- [ ] Load schema from URL via introspection
- [x] Convert schema to types
  - [x] Enums
  - [x] Comments
  - [x] InputObjects
  - [x] Objects
  - [ ] Implements
  - [ ] Custom Scalars
  - [ ] Lots of other things
- [ ] Load .yaml config
- [ ] Load .js/.ts config
- [ ] Extract and generate types for queries
- [ ] Extract and generate types for mutations
- [ ] Monorepo support

## Yo!
This is still just an experiment.
